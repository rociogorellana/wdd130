    <h2>Gissel</h2>
    <p> Hey y'all! I am from Honduras and this is my second semester at BYUI, my goal is
        to earn a bachelor in Business Management with a minor in Computer Programming.
    </p>
    <p>I love any activity that is outdoors and I enjoy spending time with my family.
        I served my mission in Atlanta Georgia and loved learning about people from different
        backgrounds, it's hard to choose a favorite scripture but the whole book of 3 Nephi is 
        one of my favorites.
