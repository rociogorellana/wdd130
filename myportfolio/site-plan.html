        About Me
        Hi! I'm Rocio Orellana, an web designer currently studying at BYU–Idaho. I'm passionate about building user-friendly websites and creating visually compelling digital experiences.
        This personal portfolio is a snapshot of who I am, what I create, and where I’m headed in the world of web development.

        My Mission
        I believe that great design is about solving problems while looking good. My mission is to combine clean, intuitive design with strong functionality to create websites that not only work well but also leave a lasting impression.

        What This Website Offers
        This site is more than just a collection of my work—it's a place to learn about me, explore my process, and see the skills I've developed so far.
        Whether you’re a potential employer, client, or peer, you’ll find examples of what I can do and how to get in touch.

      <h3>Projects Page - My work</h3>
      <p>
        Web Development Projects
        Here you’ll find a variety of projects I’ve worked on during my time at BYU–Idaho and beyond. From simple HTML/CSS landing pages to more advanced JavaScript and React applications, each project has taught me something valuable.
        I include short descriptions of the project goals, tools used, and the challenges I overcame.

        Design Portfolio
        In addition to coding, I’ve worked on the design side of web development. I enjoy using tools like Figma and Adobe XD to plan UI/UX layouts before coding begins.
        You’ll see design mockups, wireframes, and branding examples here that show my attention to visual hierarchy, color schemes, and typography.

        Technical Skills
        Each project includes the technologies I used—like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Git, and more. I also highlight any group collaboration or Agile practices I followed to bring the project to life. 
        These skills are constantly growing as I learn new frameworks and design trends.
