      <h2>Web Development Projects</h2>
      <p>Here you’ll find a variety of projects I’ve worked on during my time at BYU–Idaho and beyond. From simple HTML/CSS landing pages to more advanced JavaScript and React applications, each project has taught me something valuable.
         I include short descriptions of the project goals, tools used, and the challenges I overcame</p>

      <h2>Design Portfolio</h2>
      <p>In addition to coding, I’ve worked on the design side of web development. I enjoy using tools like Figma and Adobe XD to plan UI/UX layouts before coding begins.
         You’ll see design mockups, wireframes, and branding examples here that show my attention to visual hierarchy, color schemes, and typography.</p>

      <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
      <p>Each project includes the technologies I used—like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Git, and more. I also highlight any group collaboration or Agile practices I followed to bring the project to life. 
         These skills are constantly growing as I learn new frameworks and design trends.</p>
